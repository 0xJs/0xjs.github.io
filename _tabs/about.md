I'm a ethical hacker with a couple years of experience and i'm enthusiastic to learn a lot more about different hacking topics, especially Windows Active Directory and other Microsoft Services. I'm eager to learn and really like to take courses related to cyber security.

# Tools
- [Active Directory audit tool](https://github.com/0xJs/domain_audit) - A tool for auditing security misconfigurations within Active Directory, automating many AD checks I did as a penetration tester.
- [EnumEDRs](https://github.com/0xJs/EnumEDRs) - Enumerates running EDRs by enumerating running processes and drivers loaded.
- [EnumMitigations](https://github.com/0xJs/EnumMitigations) - Enumerate Driver, LSASS and other security services mitigations applied on a machine.
- [BYOVD EDRKiller POCS](https://github.com/0xJs/BYOVD_EDRKiller) - POC code for abusing BYOVD to kill EDR defenses through vulnerable `ZwTerminateProcess` driver.
- [BYOVD Read Write Primitive POCS](https://github.com/0xJs/BYOVD_read_write_primitive) - POC tools for leveraging a kernel-level read/write primitive to bypass security mechanisms such as LSASSâ€™s RunasPPL protection and to enumerate and remove EDR telemetry via kernel callback manipulation.
- [BlockEDRTRaffic](https://github.com/0xJs/BlockEDRTraffic) - Two tools that block network traffic for blacklisted EDR processes, using either Windows Defender Firewall (WDF) or Windows Filtering Platform (WFP).
